      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Jordan Kinney. I’m a designer who enjoys creating things that are both useful and creative. 
        I work on projects like posters, websites, and branding for different types of clients, both real and fictional. 
        I like finding ways to make ideas stand out using strong visuals, smart layouts, and fun concepts.<br><br>
        One of my favorite projects was designing for a nonprofit I started to help fight air pollution. 
        I’ve also redesigned fictional companies, made posters for big events, and created unique logos and graphics. 
        I focus on keeping my work clean, clear, and interesting. I always try to make something people will remember.<br><br>
        Design lets me be creative while also solving problems. That is what keeps me excited to keep learning and making new things.
      </p>
