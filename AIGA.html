    <h2>AIGA Digital Poster</h2>
    <h1>Developed a poster design for the 2024 AIGA Conference.</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>As part of a class assignment, I was tasked with designing a poster for the 2024 AIGA Conference. It was essential to identify key elements for the poster, such as the speakers, location, cost of attendance, and other event details. Once these parameters were established, I focused on developing a visually engaging design that would effectively advertise the event while clearly communicating all necessary information. My goal was to strike a balance between creating something eye-catching and ensuring that the content remained informative and accessible to the target audience.</p>
